		"Commentary": "Dino Game Twist is a game that rose from the ashes of another. If you read my project question essay you’ll know of the disastrous attempted game, SuperPortalGunPlus. In short, it wasn’t a success and eventually I moved on to another project. That project was Dino Game Twist. My very first game on Unity. It’s pretty simple, it’s Dino Game… but with a few twists. Like literally you have to twist the camera to keep moving. Essentially you jump over obstacles like cacti from the original game but also dodge meteors and once again turn the camera. Like I said, it’s very simple, the goal is just to get the highest score. I spent most of July and August working on this project and it came out pretty nicely. I shared it with some friends and ultimately I got the highest score because I’m the greatest at this game I made up. Although it came out nice, I tried doing a lot more with it. At one point I think I added special meteors that led to portals that led to a 3D Super Mario like boss battle where you fought against various weird things from the internet like your ISP or a crypto bro. But I never got to finish it as school started up and subsequently took up most of my time. I have recently wanted to go back and finish it but unfortunately after accidentally bricking my PC a few months ago and having to reinstall windows I lost the source code after forgetting to back it up. And since it’s a WebGL game it can’t be decompiled so if I ever go back I’ll have to work from scratch"

		"Commentary": "This one I can say quite a bit about despite it lacking so much substance. It was originally a demo I made to conceptualize something they were trying to do on the programming side of my robotics team. Then I realized that was really useless but the thing I made could be reworked into a fun thing for a game. So I looked for a game jam happening that weekend to find one that I could use it on. I found one where you had to incorporate this youtuber’s cat into it. The concept was essentially going to be a topdown bullet hell shooter where you’ve been shrunk down to the size of a bug and you have to take control of this roomba to “save” the cat from rodents by killing all the rodents. Until you find out that the rodents are harmless and the cat is just genocidal. I got a few friends together from a previous project but unfortunately nothing came of it due to me being too busy from schoolwork and whatnot. So now all I have is this demo to show for it, honestly I think one day before I graduate college I’ll probably finish it. I think it could have been really fun. Oh also you need a controller for this"

The first was also put together in Source 2 Filmmaker, but it was a lot simpler but also simultaneously really difficult for me. It was a very poor quality animation I made over the weekend of g-man jumping off a balcony after proclaiming to Gordon Freeman that he was going to, “Kermit Suicide”. Anyways, I only shared that one with friends, but then a couple days later I decided to try it again because I honestly had a lot of fun with it. Mind you this was still during covid when I had boundless amounts of time to dedicate to stupid projects. So for that entire week I decided to dedicate myself to that. Throughout that entire week I recorded the voiceover, did all the animations, etc and of course I published it on Friday of that week. It was <br><br> I had a fun time with it and there’s even a small joke in it that only I understand. You see at the very end of the animation, Alyx walks in with a crate. It’s a reference to the fact that when playing Half Life: Alyx (Which is a really good game, you should play it) I made the choice to carry a crate named… Crate with me throughout the game. No real reason why, I just thought it’d be funny. I’ll have you know that Crate unfortunately didn’t make it past the “Jeff” level. Not because he broke, but because I unfortunately couldn’t get it up a ladder I needed to progress. So I had to leave Crate behind. I hope he’s doing fine, and that he appreciates that I immortalized him in Source 2 Filmmaker."

So I decided to hop on the trend and do a little bit extra to spice it up. It started as just the meme being recreated with G-Man and Gordon Freeman but eventually I felt that it’d be funnier if I added a little voice acting to it. <br><br> Fun fact when the guy spits out his cereal I actually was eating. I went into my garage to record it after rehearsing it a few times and in order to really get a good take of it I grabbed a handful of some homemade granola my mom had made, chewed and spat it out for the spit take. Sorry mom, it was the only thing we had adjacent to cereal in the house at the time, so I just took that. Unfortunately the granola died in vain as it didn’t take off with the trend quite as I hoped.

Anyways I had about an hour before school started so I just wandered around for a bit until I found a guy from my team and some of his friends watching the Qatar World Cup. I decided to watch with them and in turn I met that girl. She called me pretty which I ate up because I was a little early transition rube who would fall in with anyone who called me pretty. That night I recorded a voiceover and over the next few days made an animation based on the encounter. Honestly, she never brought up the animation so I guess she had no clue it was about her. Anyways nothing came of it, she was bi but she had a boyfriend, who lived in like denmark, or some European country I can’t remember. Anyways I hope she’s doing well. She probably is, she was in IB and on like 15 different academic teams."

		"Commentary": "Okay this was a fun one, this one was made for my fall final in Honors US History in 11th grade. We were given the task to make a podcast about US interventionism in World War I. I immediately had the idea of making it more than just a podcast explaining some boring history shit. At this time I was watching a lot of ContraPoints and specifically drew a lot of inspiration from the “Tiffany Tumbles” and “The Hunger” videos in how there was a lot of satire but also some real humanity in the characters. I also drew a lot from Grand Theft Auto. Specifically the GTA IV talk radio show, “Pacemaker” on Public Liberty Radio in how it creates a delightfully chaotic situation with the characters. I decided to connect the topic of US interventionism to the fictitious situation of these characters being locked in their underground podcast studio. <br><br> I had the choice of doing it in a group or on my own but I chose to do it on my own because I felt like most people wouldn’t understand why I’d wanna put so much effort into a school project. I also just didn’t think most people would have shared my vision because personally for me the project was also a metaphor for my transness. As I had just come out about a week or two prior. Replace “leaving the bunker” with leaving the bunker with “leaving the closet”. With Ada killing Xavier being a metaphor for me “killing” my past self through my transition. I had to let my previous self go and take that scary step out of the bunker to live a fulfilling life just like Ada. It was a deeply personal project for me Also Ada was the name I was going by at the time and Xavier was my deadname (I already regret putting this on the internet) so that only added to the super weirdness of the whole thing. There was no deep meaning to Michael’s name, I just like the name Michael for some reason. It’s a good default name for when I can’t think of anything else. <br><br>I did all the voice acting for the characters, writing, editing and mixing myself, everything but the music, which was like some public domain muzak song along with a Diskette Park song called “REFINED” that I slowed down a lot. I even made the sound of Ada axing the door open by hitting a piece of wood with a shovel, and then the sound effect for when she killed Xavier by hitting a pile of dirt with that shovel. If you couldn’t tell, I had a lot of fun with this one. And I had even more fun when it was played in class. It was getting pretty good laughs from everyone and they seemed to like the murder at the end because of course a room full of 11th graders liked violence. My teacher was at multiple times trying to turn it off but we had to beg him to let it play. If you were wondering about the grade I got on it, I got a 92(which is probably the highest grade I ever got in that class because that teacher was super annoyingly nitpicky) and the smug satisfaction that no one else in the class would come even close to what I did.

Fun little project. Also fun tidbit, but you might notice if you’re watching my videos sequentially that since my transition I use Miss Pauling in my animations a lot and that was not coincidence. I’ve grown to use her model as a default self insert because I just really identify with her character. Especially being one of the few women in a room full of men, yk. There’s this thing about her that I think any woman can identify with where it seems like she’s adapted to this overwhelmingly masculine environment without compromising her femininity. I think she’s cool and as such she’s become a character I kinda stan(I even when as her for halloween that year)"

		"Commentary": "This video on its face is pretty small but for me it stands as a pretty good mark for the evolution of my skills. If you’ve been watching all of my animations, you probably notice that I usually use pre-created models in my animation(e.g. Scout, Mudcrab, scout in a suit, Heavy, G-Man, Gordon Freeman, Alyx, Judith Mossman, and most infamously Miss Pauling) Usually these models were those that were bundled in from the start with Source Filmmaker. But this one stands alone as the very first animation on my channel using 100% original assets, even the background was made by me as I also modeled the room in the video as a set for my little person to be one. I finally figured out how to rig a model in blender and decided to use these new found skills to make joke insult animation. The model had actually been a project I had been working on for months. Learning modeling in Blender to finally create something usable. <br><br> Unfortunately since this was my very first venture in full body modeling in blender the model kinda sucks. The topology is weird and confusing, moving the hair alone is so unoptimized that my computer has crashed multiple times whilst doing it(In fact it got so bad that I just had to turn off the Hair in the viewport), and there’s a lot weirdness in how animation on it works. In short, it’s just not a really good model to actually use. But the silver lining is that 7 months later I reworked the model and it runs significantly better. I call her Xaragame 2.0. Hopefully I can make more animations with models like Xaragame 2.0."

		"Commentary": "Alright, we’re back with another history project. You know it’s kinda weird, I didn’t even particularly like my 11th grade history teacher all that much and yet for some reason I put remarkable effort into his finals. I really don’t know why, maybe it was to spite him. But he wasn’t even my least favorite teacher. He was just a little annoying, I really didn’t have strong feelings towards him and yet I cared more about his finals than any class I’ve ever had in regular school. Anyhow, enough of Xara Shaw’s therapy session, let’s get into this one. <br><br>This one was only a part of a larger project. He assigned us to make a presentation about a modern event and I decided to make it about the 2008 recession because I had the most satire for that specific topic. This too, was another project that I was not content with doing the bare minimum on. The original script ran for 15 minutes and had a lot of commentary on the subject of wealth inequality and the incompetence of the upper class. Along with background music and multiple videos where there was a 3D animation of me coming in explaining it. My goal was to make a Youtube video essay in the form of a High School history slideshow. Unfortunately My teacher revealed after I came up with those plans that he really wanted a presentation around 7 minutes long. So I unfortunately had to cut a hell of a lot of the presentation down. The three videos turned into one satirical sketch about buy here pay here dealerships borrowing notes from the “Big Bill Hell’s” fake car dealership ad from classic youtube. I did all the animation in Source Filmmaker in the span of a weekend. The project kinda got rushed at the end since I had to do so many cuts and rewrites to stay within his timeframe.<br><br>I even came up with a playlist of songs to play in the presentation as background music like a video essay. But unfortunately he didn’t have any speakers my phone could connect to so I couldn’t play it. If you’re wondering the playlist is as follows, <br><br><ol><li>Igor’s Theme(Instrumental) - Tyler, the Creator</li><li>Replaying the Game theme</li><li>Surfin USA - Beach Boys</li><li>An Old Bassman - Isamu Ohira</li><li>Bonus.wav - Esprit</li></ol><br><br>Regardless, I gave it my best effort, I memorized every single line in the shower the night before. Researched the hell out of the material, made sure I followed every bit of the rubric. And presented it to decent praise. It wasn’t as much of a hit as Highly Debatable, honestly, I felt like I could have done a bit better but it wasn’t bad(and honestly better than most of my classmates who read off of notecards and didn’t put nearly as much effort as I did)<br><br>Anyways, after all that effort, guess what grade I get. I got a B. A B!!!!. Like a low B too, like 80%. And look, if it was on the information or whatever, I’d get that, I’m not the biggest research genius or whatever. But it wasn’t that, in fact he gave me 100% on that. He gave me 100% on literally everything EXCEPT THE PRESENTATION. Which was the part I put the MOST effort into. I honestly have no clue what I did wrong. I memorized everything, I cited my sources and I spoke very enthusiastically. The one thing I can think of possibly messing up is that I didn’t look at the audience that much. I even asked him after just to know what the reasoning was. Like what could I possibly have done wrong. But he left me unanswered. So to this day I have no clue what I did. Worst of all, that was one of the big grades I had to move up to end the year with a 4.0 GPA. It still kinda haunts me not knowing, but I for the most part I’ve gotten over it. I mean hey, after all I still made something pretty cool here."

I recommend you watch it. The clip in question is a moment where she’s recounting a weird encounter on a dating app. Overall it’s a pretty hilarious clip and is to this day probably my favorite moments of her’s.
